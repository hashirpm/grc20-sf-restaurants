    "description": "When Francis Ang opened the doors to his Kimpton Alton Hotel restaurant in Fisherman’s Wharf, the city already knew it was the breath of fresh seabreeze air diners needed. In short order his Pinoy heritage cooking drew eaters to the otherwise-for-tourists neighborhood: sisig fried rice with poached egg and pickled onions, adobo-glazed yuba skin barbecue skewer, American wagyu beef pares with parsnip and soy beef jus. Ang was a pop-up phenom before rolling out the chic bar and restaurant in 2021. The vibe is fancy but accessible; this is not a suit-and-tie restaurant, though that wouldn’t be overdressing, either. Breakfast here is geared to tourists — though a $6 bibingka rice cake with caramelized brie and salted egg is awesome any day — whereas brunch is a San Francisco-wide weekend affair. Reservations are bookable here.",

Outside of existing in as spectacular a location as possible, Dalida is simply put one of the most supreme restaurants in California. Husband-and-wife chefs Laura and Sayat Ozyilmaz say the federal land feels like a slice of the Mediterranean, ideal for showcasing their modern riffs on the cuisine. Aromatic and juicy lamb shoulder tandoor and sea urchin tahdig topped with smoked trout roe battle for main supremacy; the smart diner springs for both. For dessert, try the tavuk gogsu brulee, also known as Turkish milk pudding made with shredded chicken breast.",

There are classic options, including cheese, pepperoni, and sausage — but the pro move is to get the clam and garlic pie. It’s a zingy, briny, bready meal built on a doughy base with a sturdy bottom.

But rather than straight renditions of those dishes, he’s putting his spin on it, informed by his time at two-Michelin-starred Commis, Morimoto, and Niku Steakhouse. The result is a playful, but not stuffy, fine-dining take on Southern dishes, such as the smoked catfish dumplings, a spinoff on crayfish etouffee, or a boneless wing stuffed with dirty rice. The tasting menu is the best way to sample what Prelude has to offer, but there’s an a la carte option as well. If picking and choosing, your best bets are those aforementioned dishes, but it’s also worth trying the grits with its “smattering of garnishes,” which include perhaps some of the best bacon crumbles that grits have ever seen.",

The muffulettas aren’t overly traditional, but the changes are what make the sandwich stand out, as San Francisco Chronicle food critic Cesar Hernandez writes, such as the zingy olive salad and mayo of choice (Duke’s, if you must know). There’s the meat-loaded muffuletta and a vegetarian, roasted mushroom version, available in 1/8 or 1/4 slices or whole slabs. There’s also a pimento cheese sandwich and a pickled egg salad sandwich topped with Zapp’s potato chips, if that’s more your speed. The shop also does specials from time to time, such as a red beans and rice burrito, or a king cake around Mardi Gras time.",

That’s no exaggeration. Chef Chris Yang and partner Marcelle Gonzales Yang’s cooking has been a gold mine for the city’s diners since their Hén-zhì and El Chino Grande pop-up days. When the restaurant opened in 2023, it became a fast favorite, nabbing national accolades. The move here is the nostalgic and inventive honey walnut shrimp and pork toast, ground white shrimp and pork mousse atop the Japanese milk bread shokupan. The mala barbecue pork ribs are numbing and delectable, and wrapping the meal with the singular tofu pudding, or dou hua, is just plain smart. (The strawberry rhubarb version is a particular highlight.) The restaurant added alcohol at long last to the menu in spring 2025, which means the night market vibes are all the more powerful.",
